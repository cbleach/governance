# Workstreams

Our workstreams process allows us to be explicit about what problem areas we are working to address. This helps to keep us focused as a group while also clearly communicating externally the planned product scope of our community.

## Lifecycle

Workstreams are temporary and should be associated with a clear set of goals which, upon being reached, the workstream is paused. Each workstream also has one or more leads.

## Proposing a workstream

A proposal for a new workstream can be made via PR to this repository. This PR should create a new directory under `workstreams` which includes a `README.md` which follows the template [WorkstreamTemplate.md] found in this directory.
