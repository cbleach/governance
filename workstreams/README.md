# Workstreams

This workstreams process allows us to be explicit about what problem areas we are working to address. This helps to keep us focused as a group while also clearly communicating externally the planned product scope of our community. If you believe CNOE should be addressing a new problem area feel free to read the Proposing a workstream section below to see how to begin the conversation.

## Lifecycle

Workstreams are temporary and should be associated with a clear set of goals which, upon being reached, the workstream is paused.

## Proposing a workstream

If you have not yet communicated the proposed workstream with any CNOE members it is recommended you first create a GitHub issue with a description of the problem area you believe should be worked on, the parties interested in doing the work, and any other supporting information. This can help get quick feedback from CNOE members before spending time on the heavier weight PR process.

If there is some interest from the CNOE community, you can make a proposal for a new workstream via PR to this repository. This PR should create a new directory under `workstreams` which includes a `README.md` which follows the template [WorkstreamTemplate.md] found in this directory. For the initial PR you do not need to focus on the implementation detail sections such as communication channels and meetings, but please provide sufficient detail for the Goals and Value oriented sections.
