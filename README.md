# CNOE Governance

This document outlines the formal decision making processes which run the CNOE project.

## Principles

Mostly Borrowed from https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md:
- Open: See CONTRIBUTING.md
- Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct, below.
- Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration should be done in public. See SIG governance, below.
- Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.


## Membership

Types of members
- Users
- "Core" organizations
- Do we need to differentiate "Cloud Provider"?

### Joining

- How can users join? Slack?
- New core members can be added by unanimous vote of existing core members. As part of our first milestone we hope to better define core member criteria and processes so we can open up the ability for additional core member organizations

## Steering Committee

The steering committee consists of one member from each of the core member companies. Whether we differentiate "cloud providers" impacts this.

The steering committee is the final decision maker for CNOE and decisions are made by majority vote.

## Working Groups

Over time we will formalize our working group proceses, pulling from standard OSS processes such at Kubernetes' SIGs. In the meanwhile, the steering committee is responsible for managing the working groups CNOE consists of.
