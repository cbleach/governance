# Pre Launch Expectations

Expectations for how CNOE members operate and collaborate before publicly "launching" the organization

* Publicly launching refers to making repositories under the cnoe-io github organization publicly accessible.
* Public launching will not occur until agreed to by all steering committee members.
* All code contributions will be contributed under an Apache 2.0 License.
* Code contributions will reside in repositories within the cnoe-io github organization.
* Only individuals from member companies as decided by the steering committee will have access to code contributions before publicly launching.
* Changes to these expectations will be jointly agreed to by Amazon and Autodesk.
